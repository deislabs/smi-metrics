# Governance

## Project Maintainers

[Project maintainers](CODEOWNERS) are responsible for activities around maintaining and updating SMI Metrics. Final decisions on the project reside with the project maintainers.

Changes to the code base require approval from one project maintainer.

Maintainers MUST remain active. If they are unresponsive for >3 months, they will be automatically removed unless a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) of the other project maintainers agrees to extend the period to be greater than 3 months.

New maintainers can be added to the project by a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) vote of the existing maintainers. A potential maintainer may be nominated by an existing maintainer. A vote is conducted in private between the current maintainers over the course of a one week voting period. At the end of the week, votes are counted and a pull request is made on the repo adding the new maintainer to the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file.

A maintainer may step down by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/deislabs/smi-metrics/issues/new) stating their intent.

Changes to this governance document require a pull request with approval from a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) of the current maintainers.
